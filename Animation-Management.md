## Introduction

The Windows operating system includes many visual effects and animations that make the interface more attractive but can reduce system performance, especially on computers with limited resources. Effinitum X provides a convenient tool for managing these effects without the need to manually change system settings.

## Impact of Animations on Performance

System animations and visual effects can significantly affect computer performance:

| System Type | Animation Impact |
|-------------|------------------|
| Older computers (before 2015) | Significant performance decrease, increased interface delays |
| Medium-powered | Noticeable impact during multitasking, possible delays when working with graphics |
| Modern powerful | Minimal impact, but disabling can free up resources for demanding tasks |

Animations have the greatest impact on:
- Systems with integrated graphics
- Computers with small amounts of RAM (less than 8 GB)
- Systems with mechanical hard drives (not SSD)
- Laptops in power-saving mode

## Available Animation Settings

Effinitum X allows you to control the following Windows visual effects and animations:

### Basic Animations
- **Animation when opening and closing windows**
- **Animation when minimizing windows to the taskbar**
- **Animation when restoring windows from the taskbar**
- **Smooth cursor movement**
- **Smooth scrolling of window contents**

### Interface Effects
- **Shadows under windows**
- **Shadows under the mouse pointer**
- **Visual styles for windows and buttons**
- **Alignment of desktop icons to grid**
- **Transition effects when changing color scheme**

### Transparency and Blur
- **Window transparency (Aero effect)**
- **Blur behind window areas (Acrylic effect)**
- **Taskbar transparency**
- **Tooltip transparency**

### Special Effects
- **Peek effect (desktop preview)**
- **Animated window thumbnails on the taskbar**
- **Show window contents when dragging**
- **Animated transitions between screens**

## Ready-made Presets

Effinitum X offers several ready-made animation setting presets for quick optimization:

### No Animations
Completely disables all animations and visual effects for maximum performance. Recommended for weak computers and critical tasks that require all available resources.

**Features:**
- Instant opening/closing of windows
- No shadows and transparency
- Maximum resource savings
- Uses classic interface style

### Minimal Animations
Leaves only basic animations, disabling resource-intensive effects. A good compromise between performance and appearance.

**Features:**
- Basic window animations
- No transparency and blur effects
- Preserves important visual elements
- Moderate resource usage

### Standard Animations
Default Windows settings. A balanced set of effects.

**Features:**
- Window animations
- Shadows under windows
- Peek effect for the desktop
- Visual styles for all elements

### Enhanced Animations
Includes most visual effects while maintaining a reasonable performance balance.

**Features:**
- All standard animations
- Window transparency (Aero)
- Animated window thumbnails
- Screen transition effects

### Maximum Animations
Enables all available visual effects for maximum aesthetic experience.

**Features:**
- All possible animations
- Transparency and blur effects
- High-quality visualization
- Highest resource consumption

## Custom Effect Settings

In addition to ready-made presets, Effinitum X allows you to customize each visual effect individually:

1. Open Effinitum X
2. Go to the "Animation Management" section
3. Click the "Advanced Settings" button
4. Use the toggles to enable/disable individual effects
5. Click "Apply" to save settings

Additionally, the program offers some additional settings not available in standard Windows tools:

- **Animation speed** - changing the speed of all interface animations
- **Transparency quality** - choosing between performance and quality
- **Advanced desktop effects** - for modern graphics cards

## Recommendations

### For older computers (up to 4 GB RAM, weak graphics)
- Use the "No Animations" or "Minimal Animations" preset
- Disable all transparency effects
- Disable animations when opening/closing windows
- Disable shadows under windows

### For medium-powered computers (4-8 GB RAM)
- Use the "Minimal Animations" or "Standard Animations" preset
- Disable blur effects
- Keep basic window animations
- Temporarily disable animations when working with resource-intensive applications if needed

### For powerful modern computers (8+ GB RAM, discrete graphics)
- You can use any preset as desired
- For maximum performance in games, it's recommended to disable animations
- For comfortable everyday work, "Enhanced Animations" will be suitable

### For laptops
- When running on battery, it's recommended to use "Minimal Animations"
- When connected to power, you can use more resource-intensive presets
- Set up automatic switching of presets when changing power source

## Troubleshooting

### Animation settings are not applied
1. Make sure the program is run with administrator rights
2. Restart your computer after applying settings
3. Check if group policy is blocking settings changes (in corporate environments)

### Some effects don't work after enabling
1. Make sure your system supports these effects
2. Check for up-to-date graphics card drivers
3. Make sure you have transparency support enabled in Windows settings
4. Check performance settings in Windows Control Panel

### Interface became too "flat" after disabling effects
This is normal behavior when disabling effects. If you don't like the appearance:
1. Enable shadows under windows
2. Enable visual styles for windows and buttons
3. Keep only resource-intensive effects disabled (transparency, blur)

### Transparency issues on Windows 11
1. Open Windows Settings
2. Go to "Personalization" â†’ "Colors"
3. Make sure transparency effects are enabled
4. Check your graphics card compatibility with Mica and Acrylic effects
